# tii
An interface for irc it (ii)

Dependencies:
C89, posix, ii.

Usage:
`cd` into the `irc` directory and launch `tii`.
The `out` file will be shown in terminal, along with the selected channel, and
an input line at the bottom.
Next channel ^L, prev channel ^H.

Notes:
This is hastily written.
I've rejected malloc.
I've rejected global state.
I've experimented with semi-strange ideas.

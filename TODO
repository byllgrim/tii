TODOs

Not all of these are certainly good ideas

close all opened dirs and files
add_server -> server_add
don't return void on all functions
use write() instead of printf/puts
don't nonportable use open/read/write?
blockbuffer stdout
less ternary ? operator
sv:  irc.freenode.net [irc.oftc.net]
nb: Notification message
jk instead of np
indicate notify in other/unselected server
detect server disconnect
indicate sending to closed fifo "in: ! ..."
indicate server index "ch: ... 3/4"
set_notify(srv, srv->i, 1);
notify redraw without user input
.notify -> .alert
